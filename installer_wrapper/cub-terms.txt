CUB LINUX® TERMS, CONDITIONS AND CREDITS

GENERAL TERMS

Please read the following terms and conditions carefully. By accepting 
these terms and by using/installing Cub Linux you implicitly accept 
the license terms of Cub Linux and any bundled software. 

Cub Linux is free to use and distribute and will remain free to 
download and use forever. Cub Linux is a GNU/Linux distribution 
(https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) and it is mostly made from 
open source components, licensed under 'copyleft' agreements such as the
GNU Public License. Bundled software and other components are 
distributed under a variety of licenses and agreements as described 
below and on the credits page of the website 
(http://Cub Linux.org/sources/).

The registered trademark Linux® is used pursuant to a sublicense from 
LMI, the exclusive licensee of Linus Torvalds, owner of the mark on a 
world-wide basis.

Cub Linux contains Adobe Flash® which is not open source and whose 
license terms are found in Appendix 2. No guarantee is made 
that there are not other proprietary components included.

Any software, code, artwork or system configurations created by RichJack 
and/or under the Cub Linux or Cub Linux OS project(s) are 
released under the terms of the GNU Public License v3 (see Appendix 1).

These terms and conditions and any original written content and ideas on

DISCLAIMER

Software, code and intellectual property distributed within Cub Linux 
is to the best of knowledge free to distribute under the terms of the 
various licenses and has been appropriately attributed within these 
terms.

If you know of any software, code or intellectual property contained 
within Cub Linux that does not allow for free distribution, please 
contact us and it will be removed: contact@cublinux.com.

BUNDLED SOFTWARE

Cub Linux uses packages from the Ubuntu repositories. Ubuntu is 
comprised of many components which are licensed under varying licenses. 
See http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/licensing for more details.

Cub Linux contains the Chromium web browser which is the open source 
version of the Google Chrome browser. There is no single license file 
for Chromium that is correct for all devices and all versions, so please 
go to settings/help (or type chrome://help) and click on "open source 
software" (or type chrome://credits and chrome://os-credits) within the 
Chromium Browser. The use of Google services (Gmail, Google Drive, 
YouTube, Google Search) within the Chromium browser are subject to a 
separate agreement between you, the user, and Google Inc. The Google 
terms of service can be found here: 
http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/.

ADOBE FLASH®
 
Adobe Flash Player is provided via the Pepperflashplugin-nonfree 
package. This package downloads Google Chrome, unpacks it and places the 
Flash Player plugin where the open source Chromium browser can find it. 
Google Chrome is not installed nor otherwise used and the Google Chrome 
installer package cache has been removed from the Cub Linux ISO. From 
time to time, PepperFlashPlugin will automatically update itself 
whereupon a newer version of Google Chrome will be downloaded and 
unpacked. Google Chrome will never be installed unless the user 
explicitly visits the Google Chrome website, downloads and installs the 
Google Chrome Browser and accepts the Google Chrome license agreement. 
The terms of use for Adobe Flash Player can be found in Appendix 2. 
Please note, Adobe Flash is proprietary software of Adobe Inc. and is 
not Open Source/GPL. Adobe PepperFlash Plugin is released under its own 
sub-license of the Google Chrome license 
(https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/privacy/eula_text.html). 

If you do not wish to accept Adobe’s license terms, you can remove the 
PepperFlashPlugin using the Flash Player tool in the Control Panel. If 
you do not remove the plugin, then it is deemed that you have accepted 
the license terms the first time that you use the Chromium browser.

SOURCE CODE

The source code for the Ubuntu base can be downloaded by enabling the 
SRC repositories within Synaptic or in /etc/apt/sources.list. This 
command will pull down the source for any package: apt-get source 
<package>. Alternatively, you may browse packages and their sources at 
http://packages.ubuntu.com/.

In Cub Linux the Main, Universe, Multiverse, Restricted, Partner and 
Extra repositories along with their updates and security-updates 
counterparts are enabled by default. Software from the Multiverse, 
Restricted, Partner and Extra repositories may contain proprietary 
software, software subject to copyright or legal issues and software 
with restricted and/or proprietary licenses. If you do not wish to 
install such software, then please disable these repositories using the 
Software and Updates tool from the Control Panel.

The source code for all bespoke scripts and graphics can be found at:

APPENDIX 1

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software 
and other kinds of works.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to 
take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the 
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free 
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the 
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to 
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to 
your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if 
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, 
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free 
programs, and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these 
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have 
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if 
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis 
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that 
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights.
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: 
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License 
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains 
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and 
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as 
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to 
authors of previous versions.
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run 
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer 
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting 
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such 
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is 
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed 
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. 
If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to 
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as 
needed to protect the freedom of users.
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of 
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to 
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could 
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that 
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of 
works, such as semiconductor masks.
“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this 
License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and 
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.
To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work 
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an 
exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the 
earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.
A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on 
the Program.
To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without 
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for 
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a 
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, 
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the 
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other 
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through 
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to 
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature 
that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the 
user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that 
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this 
License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface 
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent 
item in the list meets this criterion.
1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a 
work.
A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official 
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of 
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is 
widely used among developers working in that language.
The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other 
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of 
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major 
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major 
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an 
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major 
Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, 
window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on 
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, 
or an object code interpreter used to run it.
The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the 
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) 
run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control 
those activities. However, it does not include the work's System 
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs 
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are 
not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes 
interface definition files associated with source files for the work, 
and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked 
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as 
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms 
and other parts of the work.
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can 
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same 
work.
2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of 
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated 
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited 
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a 
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its c
ontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your 
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, 
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. 
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having 
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with 
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the 
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not 
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for 
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and 
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your 
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the 
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes 
it unnecessary.
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological 
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar 
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid 
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention 
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the 
covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or 
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's 
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of 
technological measures.
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you 
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep 
intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive 
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all 
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy 
of this License along with the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and 
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to 
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms 
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, 
and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released 
under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This 
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all 
notices”.
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to 
anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore 
apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the 
whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are 
packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any 
other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have 
separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display 
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive 
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need 
not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent 
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and 
which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or 
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used 
to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond 
what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an 
aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the 
aggregate.
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of 
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable 
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these 
ways:
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the 
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used 
for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written 
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer 
spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone 
who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding 
Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this 
License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software 
interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically 
performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the 
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the 
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is 
allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received 
the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place 
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the 
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no 
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the 
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy 
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on 
a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports 
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions 
next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. 
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain 
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to 
satisfy these requirements.
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you 
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the 
work are being offered to the general public at no charge under 
subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded 
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included 
in conveying the object code work.
A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any 
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, 
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for 
incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a 
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. 
For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” 
refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless 
of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the 
particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the 
product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the 
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, 
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the 
product.
“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, 
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install 
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product 
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information 
must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified 
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because 
modification has been made.
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or 
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as 
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the 
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a 
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the 
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by 
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if 
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified 
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been 
installed in ROM).
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a 
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates 
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for 
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a 
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and 
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and 
protocols for communication across the network.
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in 
accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented 
(and with an implementation available to the public in source code 
form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, 
reading or copying.
7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this 
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. 
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall 
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent 
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions 
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately 
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this 
License without regard to the additional permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove 
any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. 
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in 
certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional 
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you 
have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you 
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders 
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms 
of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or 
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices 
displayed by works containing it; or
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or 
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in 
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or 
authors of the material; or
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade 
names, trademarks, or service marks; or
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material 
by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with 
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability 
that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors 
and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further 
restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you 
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is 
governed by this License along with a term that is a further 
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a 
further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this 
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of 
that license document, provided that the further restriction does not 
survive such relicensing or conveying.
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must 
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms 
that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the 
applicable terms.
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the 
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above 
requirements apply either way.
8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly 
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or 
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under 
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third 
paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license 
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, 
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates 
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to 
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days 
after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated 
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by 
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice 
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, 
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the 
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the 
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under 
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently 
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same 
material under section 10.
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a 
copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring 
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a 
copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than 
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered 
work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you 
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically 
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and 
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible 
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an 
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an 
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work 
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who 
receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work 
the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous 
paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the 
work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can 
get it with reasonable efforts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the 
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not 
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights 
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any 
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, 
or importing the Program or any portion of it.
11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this 
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work 
thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.
A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or 
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter 
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this 
License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do 
not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of 
further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this 
definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in 
a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free 
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, 
use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and 
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express 
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent 
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to 
sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a 
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a 
patent against the party.
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and 
the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to 
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a 
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, 
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so 
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the 
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner 
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent 
license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have a
ctual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the 
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work 
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that 
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or 
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a 
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties 
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or 
convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you 
grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work 
and works based on it.
A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the 
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on 
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically 
granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are 
a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of 
distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party 
based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under 
which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive 
the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in 
connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies 
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with 
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless 
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, 
prior to 28 March 2007.
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any 
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be 
available to you under applicable patent law.
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a 
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that 
obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to 
whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those 
terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the 
Program.
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission 
to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 
3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, 
and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will 
continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special 
requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, 
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination 
as such.
14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public 
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of 
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public 
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation.
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions 
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public 
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to 
choose that version for the Program.
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. 
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or 
copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE 
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS 
IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE 
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. 
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES 
AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU 
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD 
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above 
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing 
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute 
waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a 
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in 
return for a fee.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these 
terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to 
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state 
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 
“copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice 
like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
   <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 
    `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.


The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the 
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your 
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would 
use an “about box”.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or 
school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if 
necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the 
GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your 
program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine 
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary 
applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the 
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, 
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

APPENDIX 2

ADOBE

Google Chrome may include one or more components provided by Adobe 
Systems Incorporated and Adobe Software Ireland Limited (collectively 
“Adobe”). Your use of the Adobe software as provided by Google (“Adobe

support for PDF and EPUB formats and Adobe DRM.
2. Electronic Transmission. Sublicensee may allow the download of the 
Adobe Software from a web site, the Internet, an intranet, or similar 
technology (an, “Electronic Transmissions”) provided that Sublicensee 
agrees that any distributions of the Adobe Software by Sublicensee, 
including those on CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or other storage media and Electronic 
Transmissions, if expressly permitted, shall be subject to reasonable 
security measures to prevent unauthorized use. With relation to

4. Opensource. Sublicensee will not directly or indirectly grant, or 
purport to grant, to any third party any rights or immunities under 
Adobe’s intellectual property or proprietary rights that will subject 
such intellectual property to an open source license or scheme in which 
there is or could be interpreted to be a requirement that as a condition 
of use, modification and/or distribution, the Adobe Software be: (i) 
disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii) licensed for the 
purpose of making derivative works; or (iii) redistributable at no 
charge. For clarification purposes, the foregoing restriction does not 
preclude Sublicensee from distributing, and Sublicensee will distribute 
the Adobe Software as bundled with the Google Software, without charge.
5. Additional Terms. With respect to any update, upgrade, new versions 
of the Adobe Software (collectively “Upgrades”) provided to Sublicenses, 
Adobe reserves the right to require additional terms and conditions 
applicable solely to the Upgrade and future versions thereof, and solely 
to the extent that such restrictions are imposed by Adobe on all 
licensees of such Upgrade. If Sublicensee does not agree to such 
additional terms or conditions, Sublicensee will have no license rights 
with respect to such Upgrade, and Sublicensee’s license rights with 
respect to the Adobe Software will terminate automatically on the 90th 
day from the date such additional terms are made available to 
Sublicensee.
6. Proprietary Rights Notices. Sublicensee shall not, and shall require 
its distributors not to, delete or in any manner alter the copyright 
notices, trademarks, logos or related notices, or other proprietary 
rights notices of Adobe (and its licensors, if any) appearing on or 
within the Adobe Software or accompanying materials.
7. Technical Requirements. Sublicensee and its distributors may only 
distribute Adobe Software and/or Upgrade on devices that (i) meet the 
technical specifications posted on 
http://www.adobe.com/mobile/licensees, (or a successor web site

8. Verification and Update. Sublicensee must submit to Adobe each 
Sublicensee product (and each version thereof) containing the Adobe 
Software and/or Upgrade (“Sublicensee Product”) that do not meet the 
Device Verification exemption criteria to be communicated by Google, for 
Adobe to verify. Sublicensee shall pay for each submission made by 
Sublicensee by procuring verification packages at Adobe’s then-current 
terms set forth at http://flashmobile.adobe.com/. Sublicensee Product 
that has not passed verification may not be distributed. Verification 
will be accomplished in accordance with Adobe’s then-current process 
described at http://flashmobile.adobe.com/ (“Verification”).
9. Profiles and Device Central. Sublicensee will be prompted to enter 
certain profile information about the Sublicensee Products either as 
part of the Verification process or some other method, and Sublicensee 
will provide such information, to Adobe. Adobe may (i) use such profile 
information as reasonably necessary to verify the Sublicensee Product 
(if such product is subject to Verification), and (ii) display such 
profile information in “Adobe Device Intelligence system,” located at 
https://devices.adobe.com/partnerportal/, and made available through 
Adobe’s authoring and development tools and services to enable 
developers and end users to see how content or applications are 
displayed in Sublicensee Products (e.g. how video images appear in 
certain phones).
10. Export. Sublicensee acknowledges that the laws and regulations of 
the United States restrict the export and re-export of commodities and 
technical data of United States origin, which may include the Adobe 
Software. Sublicensee agrees that it will not export or re-export the 
Adobe Software, without the appropriate United States and foreign g
overnmental clearances, if any.
11. Technology Pass-through Terms.
(a) Except pursuant to applicable permissions or agreements therefor, 
from or with the applicable parties, Sublicensees shall not use and 
shall not allow the use of, the Adobe Software for the encoding or 
decoding of mp3 audio only (.mp3) data on any non-pc device (e.g., 
mobile phone or set-top box), nor may the mp3 encoders or decoders 
contained in the Adobe Software be used or accessed by any product other 
than the Adobe Software. The Adobe Software may be used for the encoding 
or decoding of MP3 data contained within a swf or flv file, which 
contains video, picture or other data. Sublicensee shall acknowledge that 
use of the Adobe Software for non-PC devices, as described in the 
prohibitions in this section, may require the payment of licensing 
royalties or other amounts to third parties who may hold intellectual 
property rights related to the MP3 technology and that Adobe nor 
Sublicensee has not paid any royalties or other amounts on account of 
third party intellectual property rights for such use. If Sublicensee 
requires an MP3 encoder or decoder for such use, Sublicensee is 
responsible for obtaining the necessary intellectual property license, 
including any applicable patent rights.
(b) Sublicensee will not use, copy, reproduce and modify (i) the On2 
source code (provided hereunder as a component of the Source Code) as 
necessary to enable the Adobe Software to decode video in the Flash 
video file format (.flv or .f4v), and (ii) the Sorenson Spark source 
code (provided hereunder as a component of the Source Code) for the 
limited purpose of making bug fixes and performance enhancements to the 
Adobe Software. All codecs provided with the Adobe Software may only be 
used and distributed as an integrated part of the Adobe Software and may 
not be accessed by any other application, including other Google 
applications.
(c) The Source Code may be provided with an AAC codec and/or HE-AAC 
codec (“the AAC Codec”). Use of the AAC Codec is conditioned on 
Sublicensee obtaining a proper patent license covering necessary patents 
as provided by VIA Licensing, for end products on or in which the AAC 
Codec will be used. Sublicensee acknowledges and agrees that Adobe is 
not providing a patent license for an AAC Codec under this Agreement to 
Sublicensee or its sublicensees.
(d) THE SOURCE CODE MAY CONTAIN CODE LICENSED UNDER THE AVC PATENT 
PORTFOLIO LICENSE FOR THE PERSONAL NON-COMMERCIAL USE OF A CONSUMER 
TO (i) ENCODE VIDEO IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AVC STANDARD 
("AVC VIDEO") AND/OR (ii) DECODE AVC VIDEO THAT WAS ENCODED BY A 
CONSUMER ENGAGED IN A PERSONAL NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AND/OR WAS 
OBTAINED FROM A VIDEO PROVIDER LICENSED TO PROVIDE AVC VIDEO. NO 
LICENSE IS GRANTED OR WILL BE IMPLIED FOR ANY OTHER USE. ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED FROM MPEG LA, L.L.C. 
See http://www.mpegla.com
12. Update. Sublicensee will not circumvent Google’s or Adobe’s efforts 
to update the Adobe Software in all Sublicensee’s products incorporating 
the Adobe Software as bundled with the Google Software 
(“Sublicensee Products”).
13. Attribution and Proprietary Notices. Sublicensee will list the Adobe 
Software in publicly available Sublicensee Product specifications and 
include appropriate Adobe Software branding (specifically excluding the 
Adobe corporate logo) on the Sublicensee Product packaging or marketing 
materials in a manner consistent with branding of other third party 
products contained within the Sublicensee Product.
14. No Warranty. THE ADOBE SOFTWARE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO SUBLICENSEE 
FOR USE AND REPRODUCTION “AS IS” AND ADOBE MAKES NO WARRANTY AS TO 
ITS USE OR PERFORMANCE. ADOBE AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT AND CANNOT 
WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OBTAINED BY USING THE ADOBE 
SOFTWARE. EXCEPT FOR ANY WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION OR 
TERM TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SAME CANNOT OR MAY NOT BE EXCLUDED 
OR LIMITED BY LAW APPLICABLE TO SUBLICENSEEIN SUBLICENSEE’S 
JURISDICTION, ADOBE AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, 
CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, OR TERMS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WHETHER 
BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE OR OTHERWISE) AS TO ANY 
MATTER INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY 
RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, INTEGRATION, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OR 
FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SUBLICENSEE AGREES THAT 
SUBLICENSEE SHALL NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
ON BEHALF OF ADOBE.
15. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL ADOBE OR ITS SUPPLIERS 
BE LIABLE TO SUBLICENSEE FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS WHATSOEVER 
OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST 
PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, EVEN IF AN ADOBE REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS OR 
FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND 
EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN 
SUBLICENSEE’S JURISDICTION. ADOBE’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY AND THAT OF 
ITS SUPPLIERS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE 
LIMITED TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (US$1,000). 
Nothing contained in this Agreement limits Adobe’s liability 
to Sublicensee in the event of death or personal injury resulting from 
Adobe’s negligence or for the tort of deceit (fraud). Adobe is acting on 
behalf of its suppliers for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and/or 
limiting obligations, warranties and liability as provided in this 
Agreement, but in no other respects and for no other purpose.
16. Content Protection Terms
(a) Definitions.
“Compliance and Robustness Rules” means the document setting forth 
compliance and robustness rules for the Adobe Software located at 
http://www.adobe.com/mobile/licensees, or a successor web site thereto.
“Content Protection Functions” means those aspects of the Adobe Software 
that are designed to ensure compliance with the Compliance and 
Robustness Rules, and to prevent playback, copying, modification, 
redistribution or other actions with respect to digital content 
distributed for consumption by users of the Adobe Software when such 
actions are not authorized by the owners of such digital content or its 
licensed distributors.
“Content Protection Code” means code within certain designated versions 
of the Adobe Software that enables certain Content Protection Functions.
“Key” means a cryptographic value contained in the Adobe Software for 
use in decrypting digital content.
(b) License Restrictions. Sublicensee’s right to exercise the licenses 
with respect to the Adobe Software is subject to the following 
additional restrictions and obligations. Sublicensee will ensure that 
Sublicensee’s customers comply with these restrictions and obligations 
to the same extent imposed on Sublicensee with respect to the Adobe 
Software; any failure by Sublicensee’s customers to comply with these 
additional restrictions and obligations shall be treated as a material 
breach by Sublicensee.
b.1. Sublicensee and customers may only distribute the Adobe Software 
that meets the Robustness and Compliance Rules as so confirmed by 
Sublicensee during the verification process described above in the Adobe 
Terms.
b.2. Sublicensee shall not (i) circumvent the Content Protection 
Functions of either the Adobe Software or any related Adobe Software 
that is used to encrypt or decrypt digital content for authorized 
consumption by users of the Adobe Software, or (ii) develop or 
distribute products that are designed to circumvent the Content 
Protection Functions of either the Adobe Software or any Adobe Software 
that is used to encrypt or decrypt digital content for authorized 
consumption by users of the Adobe Software.
(c) The Keys are hereby designated as Adobe’s Confidential Information, 
and Sublicensee will, with respect to the Keys, adhere to Adobe’s Source 
Code Handling Procedure (to be provided by Adobe upon request).
(d) Injunctive Relief. Sublicensee agrees that a breach of this 
Agreement may compromise the Content Protection Functions of the Adobe 
Software and may cause unique and lasting harm to the interests of Adobe 
and owners of digital content that rely on such Content Protection 
Functions, and that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate 
fully for such harm. Therefore, Sublicensee further agrees that Adobe 
may be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent or limit the harm 
caused by any such breach, in addition to monetary damages.
17. Intended Third-party Beneficiary. Adobe Systems Incorporated and 
Adobe Software Ireland Limited are the intended third-party 
beneficiaries of Google’s agreement with Sublicensee with respect to the 
Adobe Software, including but not limited to, the Adobe Terms. 
Sublicensee agrees, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in its 
agreement with Google, that Google may disclose Sublicensee’s identity 
to Adobe and certify in writing that Sublicensee has entered into a 
license agreement with Google which includes the Adobe Terms. 
Sublicensee must have an agreement with each of its licensees, and if 
such licensees are allowed to redistribute the Adobe Software, such 
agreement will include the Adobe Terms.
